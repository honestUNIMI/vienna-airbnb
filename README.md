# Group project for the exam of Advanced Multivariate Statistics

TOPICS:
- Exploratory data analysis + create maps (**Luca**);
- Bootstrapping and simulation-based inference (**Cihan**);
    _Applications: regression_
- Multilevel models (**Tommaso**);
  _Applications: regression_
- Generic computation algorithms (**Cihan + Tommaso**);
- Robust inference (**Luca**);
  _Applications: regression_
- Model-based clustering (**Honest**);
  _Applications: cluster houses based on neighborhood_
- Robust clustering (**Honest**).

Research question: can we predict prices based on the characteristics of the house, reviews, etc? Similarities in houses located in the same neighborhood?
